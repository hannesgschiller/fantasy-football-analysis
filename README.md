## 📊 Data Sources

This project can work with various football data sources:

- **StatsBomb**: Free football data API
- **Wyscout**: Professional scouting data
- **Opta**: Official match statistics
- **Understat**: Expected goals and advanced metrics
- **Custom datasets**: CSV, Excel, or database connections

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Player Analysis
- Performance metrics tracking
- Player comparison and benchmarking
- Transfer value prediction
- Injury risk assessment

### Team Analysis
- Tactical formation evaluation
- Team performance trends
- Opposition analysis
- Set-piece effectiveness

### Match Prediction
- Match outcome forecasting
- Goal scoring prediction
- Player performance prediction
- Tactical matchup analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Data Collection**:
   ```python
   from src.data_processing.data_collector import DataCollector
   
   collector = DataCollector()
   data = collector.get_match_data(league="Premier League", season="2023/24")
   ```

2. **Data Analysis**:
   ```python
   from src.visualization.analytics import FootballAnalytics
   
   analytics = FootballAnalytics(data)
   analytics.plot_team_performance()
   ```

3. **Model Training**:
   ```python
   from src.models.match_predictor import MatchPredictor
   
   predictor = MatchPredictor()
   predictor.train(data)
   predictions = predictor.predict_next_matches()
   ```

## 📈 Example Analyses
